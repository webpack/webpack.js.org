It can handle fonts, images, data and more with the help of community-driven plugins and loaders. Having all of your assets be handled by one tool is immensely helpful, as you or your team can spend less time making sure a machine with many moving parts is working correctly and more time building your product.</p>\n<h3 id="sponsorship">Sponsorship<a href="#sponsorship" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h3>\n<p>Aside from monetary assistance, companies can support webpack by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Providing developers that are not actively working on a project.</li>\n<li>Contributing computing power for improved CI and regression testing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also encourage your developers to contribute to the ecosystem by open-sourcing webpack loaders, plugins and other utilities.

An automated issue creation integration was established and proven to be effective in the recent years.\nWhen a feature gets merged, an issue with a documentation request is created in our repository and we expect to resolve it in a timely manner. This means that there are features, changes and breaking changes awaiting to be documented, reviewed and released. That said, if Pull Request\'s author is abandoning it for more than 30 days, we may mark such Pull Request as stale. We may take over the work that is needed to finish it.\nIf Pull Request author grants write access to their fork to the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/webpack/teams/documentation-team/members">webpack Documentation team</a> we will commit directly to your branch and finish the work. In other cases, we may have to start over by ourselves or by delegating it to willing community members. This may render your Pull Request redundant and it might get closed as a part of the cleanup process.</p>\n'}}]);
