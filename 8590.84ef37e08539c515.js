These\nindividuals are identified by the WG and their addition as\nCollaborators is discussed during the weekly WG meeting.\n\nModifications of the contents of the *[insert WG repo]* repository are made on\na collaborative basis. Anybody with a GitHub account may propose a\nmodification via pull request and it will be considered by the project\nCollaborators. All pull requests must be reviewed and accepted by a\nCollaborator with sufficient expertise who is able to take full\nresponsibility for the change. In the case of pull requests proposed\nby an existing Collaborator, an additional Collaborator is required\nfor sign-off. Consensus should be sought if additional Collaborators\nparticipate and there is disagreement around a particular\nmodification. See _Consensus Seeking Process_ below for further detail\non the consensus model used for governance.\n\nFor the current list of Collaborators, see the project\n[README.md](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/README.md#current-project-members).\n\n### WG Membership\n\nWG seats are not time-limited.  There is no fixed size of the WG.\nHowever, the expected target is between 6 and 12, to ensure adequate\ncoverage of important areas of expertise, balanced with the ability to\nmake decisions efficiently.\n\nThere is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for WG\nmembership beyond these rules.\n\nThe WG may add additional members to the WG by unanimous consensus.\n\nA WG member may be removed from the WG by voluntary resignation, or by\nunanimous consensus of all other WG members.\n\nChanges to WG membership should be posted in the agenda, and may be\nsuggested as any other agenda item (see "WG Meetings" below).\n\nIf an addition or removal is proposed during a meeting, and the full\nWG is not in attendance to participate, then the addition or removal\nis added to the agenda for the subsequent meeting.  This is to ensure\nthat all members are given the opportunity to participate in all\nmembership decisions.  If a WG member is unable to attend a meeting\nwhere a planned membership decision is being made, then their consent\nis assumed.\n\nNo more than 1/3 of the WG members may be affiliated with the same\nemployer.  If removal or resignation of a WG member, or a change of\nemployment by a WG member, creates a situation where more than 1/3 of\nthe WG membership shares an employer, then the situation must be\nimmediately remedied by the resignation or removal of one or more WG\nmembers affiliated with the over-represented employer(s).\n\n### Consensus Seeking Process\n\nThe WG follows a [Consensus Seeking][] decision-making model.\n\nIf an agenda item cannot reach a consensus a WG member can call for\neither a closing vote or a vote to table the issue to the next\nmeeting. The call for a vote must be seconded by a majority of the WG\nor else the discussion will continue. Simple majority wins.\n\nNote that changes to WG membership require unanimous consensus.
