Guides, documentation, and all things webpack.

</div>

## Content Progress

Now that we've covered much of the backlog of _missing documentation_, we are
starting to heavily review each section of the site's content to sort and
structure it appropriately. The following issues should provide a pretty good
idea of where things are, and where they are going:

- [Guides - Review and Simplify][guides-url]
- [Concepts - Review and Organize][concepts-url]

We haven't created issues for the other sections yet, but they will be coming
soon. For dev-related work please see [General - Updates & Fixes][general-url].

## Translation

To help translate this documentation please jump to the [translation branch][translate-url].

## Versioning

Since webpack 4 we have created a subdomain-based archive for older states of documentation
matching older webpack version. webpack 4's documentation is available at
[https://v4.webpack.js.org/](https://v4.webpack.js.org/) and is deployed from [`gh-pages` branch of v4.webpack.js.org repository](https://github.com/webpack/v4.webpack.js.org/tree/gh-pages)

There are various known issues that need fixing ([#3366](https://github.com/webpack/webpack.js.org/issues/3366)).
