For proper usage and easy distribution of this configuration, webpack can be configured with `webpack.config.js`. Any parameters sent to the CLI will map to a corresponding parameter in the configuration file.

Read the [installation guide](/guides/installation) if you don't already have webpack and CLI installed.

## Commands

webpack-cli offers a variety of commands to make working with webpack easy. By default webpack ships with

### Negated Flags

| Flag       | Description                                                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |

| --no-hot   | Disabled hot reloading if you have it enabled via your config |
| --no-stats | Disables any compilation stats emitted by webpack             |

### Core Flags

Starting CLI v4 and webpack v5, CLI imports the entire configuration schema from webpack core to allow tuning almost every configuration option from the command line.

__Here's the list of all the core flags supported by webpack v5 with CLI v4 - [link](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-cli/tree/next/packages/webpack-cli#webpack-5)__

For example if you want to enable performance hints in your project you'd use [this](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/performance/#performancehints) option in configuration, with core flags you can do -

```bash
webpack --performance-hints warning
```

## Usage

### With configuration file

```bash
webpack [--config webpack.config.js]
```

See [configuration](/configuration) for the options in the configuration file.

### Without configuration file

```sh
webpack <entry> [<entry>] -o <output-path>
```

__example__

```sh
webpack --entry ./first.js --entry ./second.js --output-path /build
```

__`<entry>`__

A filename or a set of named filenames which act as the entry point to build your project. You can pass multiple entries (every entry is loaded on startup). If you pass a pair in the form `<name>=<request>`, you can create an additional entry point. It will be mapped to the configuration option `entry`.

__`<output>`__

A path for the bundled file to be saved in. It will be mapped to the configuration options `output.path`.

__Example__

If your project structure is as follows -

```bash
.
├── dist
├── index.html
└── src
    ├── index.js
    ├── index2.js
    └── others.js
```

```bash
webpack ./src/index.js -o dist
```

This will bundle your source code with entry as `index.js`, and the output bundle file will have a path of `dist`.

```bash
asset main.js 142 bytes [compared for emit] [minimized] (name: main)
./src/index.js 30 bytes [built] [code generated]
./src/others.js 1 bytes [built] [code generated]
webpack 5.1.0 compiled successfully in 187 ms
```

```bash
webpack ./src/index.js ./src/others2.js -o dist/
```

This will form the bundle with both the files as separate entry points.

```bash
asset main.js 142 bytes [compared for emit] [minimized] (name: main)
./src/index.js 30 bytes [built] [code generated]
./src/others2.js 1 bytes [built] [code generated]
./src/others.js 1 bytes [built] [code generated]
webpack 5.1.0 compiled successfully in 198 ms
```

## Default Configurations

CLI will look for some default configurations in the path of your project, here are the config files picked up by CLI.

If no `mode` is supplied via flags or config then this is the lookup order in increasing order

> example - config file lookup will be in order of .webpack/webpack.config.development.js > webpack.config.development.js > webpack.config.js

```md
'webpack.config',
'webpack.config.dev',
'webpack.config.development',
'webpack.config.prod',
'webpack.config.production',
'.webpack/webpack.config',
'.webpack/webpack.config.none',
'.webpack/webpack.config.dev',
'.webpack/webpack.config.development',
'.webpack/webpack.config.prod',
'.webpack/webpack.config.production',
'.webpack/webpackfile',
```

If `mode` is supplied, say `production` then config looking order will be -

`.webpack/webpack.config.production.* > .webpack/webpack.config.prod.* > webpack.config.production.* > webpack.config.prod.* > webpack.config.*`

## Common Options

W> Note that Command Line Interface has a higher precedence for the arguments you use it with than your configuration file. For instance, if you pass [`--mode="production"`](/configuration/mode/#usage) to webpack CLI and your configuration file uses `development`, `production` will be used.

__List all of the commands and flags available on the cli__

```bash
webpack --help
```

__Show help for a single command or flag__

```bash
webpack --help <command>
webpack --help --<flag>
```

__Build source using a configuration file__

Specifies a different [configuration](/configuration) file to pick up. Use this if you want to specify something different from `webpack.config.js`, which is one of the default.

```bash
webpack --config example.config.js
```

__Print result of webpack as a JSON__

```bash
webpack --json
```

__If you want to store stats as json instead of printing it, you can use -__

```bash
webpack --json stats.json
```

In every other case, webpack prints out a set of stats showing bundle, chunk and timing details. Using this option, the output can be a JSON object. This response is accepted by webpack's [analyse tool](https://webpack.github.io/analyse/), or chrisbateman's [webpack-visualizer](https://chrisbateman.github.io/webpack-visualizer/), or th0r's [webpack-bundle-analyzer](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer). The analyse tool will take in the JSON and provide all the details of the build in graphical form.

## Environment Options

When the webpack configuration [exports a function](/configuration/configuration-types/#exporting-a-function), an "environment" may be passed to it.

```bash
webpack --env production    # sets env.production == true
```

The `--env` argument accepts multiple values:

| Invocation                     | Resulting environment       |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| `webpack --env prod`           | `{ prod: true }`            |
| `webpack --env prod --env min` | `{ prod: true, min: true }` |

T> See the [environment variables](/guides/environment-variables/) guide for more information on its usage.

## Configuration Options

| Parameter       | Explanation                                                    | Input type | Default                                             |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `--config`      | Path to the configuration file                                 | string     | [Default Configs](/api/cli/#default-configurations) |
| `--config-name` | Name of the configuration to use                               | string     |
| `--env`         | Environment passed to the configuration, when it is a function |            |
| `--mode`        | Mode to use                                                    | string     | `'production'`                                      |

## Analyzing Bundle

You can also use `webpack-bundle-analyzer` to analyze your output bundles emitted by webpack. You can use `--analyze` flag to invoke it via CLI.

```sh
webpack --analyze
```

W> Make sure you have `webpack-bundle-analyzer` installed in your project else CLI will prompt you to install it.

## Pass CLI arguments to Node.js

To pass arguments directly to Node.js process, you can use the `NODE_OPTIONS` option.

For example, to increase the memory limit of Node.js process to 4 GB

```bash
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096" webpack
```

Also, you can pass multiple options to Node.js process

```bash
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096 -r /path/to/preload/file.js" webpack
```
