The `Compilation` module is used by the `Compiler` to create new compilations
(or builds). A `compilation` instance has access to all modules and their
dependencies (most of which are circular references). It is the literal
compilation of all the modules in the dependency graph of an application.
During the compilation phase, modules are loaded, sealed, optimized, chunked,
hashed and restored.

The `Compilation` class also extends `Tapable` and provides the following
lifecycle hooks. They can be tapped the same way as compiler hooks:

```js
compilation.hooks.someHook.tap(/* ... */);
```

As with the `compiler`, `tapAsync` and `tapPromise` may also be available
depending on the type of hook.

### `buildModule`

`SyncHook`

Triggered before a module build has started, can be used to modify the module.

- Callback Parameters: `module`

```js
compilation.hooks.buildModule.tap(
  'SourceMapDevToolModuleOptionsPlugin',
  (module) => {
    module.useSourceMap = true;
  }
);
```

### `rebuildModule`

- Callback Parameters: `module`

### `finishModules`

`AsyncSeriesHook`

Called when all modules have been built without errors.

### `beforeModuleHash`

`SyncHook`

Called before the compilation is hashed.

### `beforeHash`

`SyncHook`

### `beforeModuleAssets`

`SyncHook`

Executed before module assets creation.

### `additionalChunkAssets`

`SyncHook`

W> `additionalChunkAssets` is deprecated (use the [Compilation.hook.processAssets](#processassets) instead and use one of the Compilation.PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE\_\* as a stage option)

Create additional assets for the chunks.

- Callback Parameters: `chunks`

### `shouldGenerateChunkAssets`

`SyncBailHook`

Called to determine whether or not generate chunks assets. Returning anything `!== false` will allow chunk assets generation.

### `beforeChunkAssets`

`SyncHook`

Executed before creating the chunks assets.

### `additionalAssets`

`AsyncSeriesHook`

Create additional assets for the compilation. This hook can be used to download
an image, for example:

```js
compilation.hooks.additionalAssets.tapAsync('MyPlugin', (callback) => {
  download('https://img.shields.io/npm/v/webpack.svg', function (resp) {
    if (resp.status === 200) {
      compilation.assets['webpack-version.svg'] = toAsset(resp);
      callback();
    } else {
      callback(
        new Error('[webpack-example-plugin] Unable to download the image')
      );
    }
  });
});
```

### `optimizeChunkAssets`

`AsyncSeriesHook`

W> `optimizeChunkAssets` is deprecated (use the [Compilation.hook.processAssets](#processassets) instead and use one of the Compilation.PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE\_\* as a stage option)

Optimize any chunk assets. The assets are stored in `compilation.assets`. A
`Chunk` has a property `files` which points to all files created by a chunk.
Any additional chunk assets are stored in `compilation.additionalChunkAssets`.

- Callback Parameters: `chunks`

Here's an example that simply adds a banner to each chunk.

```js
compilation.hooks.optimizeChunkAssets.tapAsync(
  'MyPlugin',
  (chunks, callback) => {
    chunks.forEach((chunk) => {
      chunk.files.forEach((file) => {
        compilation.assets[file] = new ConcatSource(
          '/**Sweet Banner**/',
          '\n',
          compilation.assets[file]
        );
      });
    });

    callback();
  }
);
```

### `afterOptimizeChunkAssets`

`SyncHook`

W> `afterOptimizeChunkAssets` is deprecated (use the [Compilation.hook.processAssets](#processassets) instead and use one of the Compilation.PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE\_\* as a stage option)

The chunk assets have been optimized.

- Callback Parameters: `chunks`

Here's an example plugin from [@boopathi](https://github.com/boopathi) that outputs exactly what went into each chunk.

```js
compilation.hooks.afterOptimizeChunkAssets.tap('MyPlugin', (chunks) => {
  chunks.forEach((chunk) => {
    console.log({
      id: chunk.id,
      name: chunk.name,
      includes: chunk.getModules().map((module) => module.request),
    });
  });
});
```

### `optimizeAssets`

`AsyncSeriesHook`

Optimize all assets stored in `compilation.assets`.

- Callback Parameters: `assets`

### `afterOptimizeAssets`

`SyncHook`

The assets have been optimized.

- Callback Parameters: `assets`

### `processAssets`

`AsyncSeriesHook`

Asset processing.

- Callback Parameters: `assets`

Here's an example:

```js
compilation.hooks.processAssets.tap(
  {
    name: 'MyPlugin',
    stage: Compilation.PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_ADDITIONS, // see below for more stages
  },
  (assets) => {
    // code here
  }
);
```

In addition to `name` and `stage`, you can pass a `additionalAssets` <Badge text='5.8.0+' /> option which accepts either a value of `true` or a function with `assets` as parameter:

1. `true` - Run callback against assets added later by plugins.

   ```js
   compilation.hooks.processAssets.tap(
     {
       name: 'MyPlugin',
       stage: Compilation.PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_DEV_TOOLING,
       additionalAssets: true,
     },
     (assets) => {
       // this callback will run against assets added later by plugins.
     }
   );
   ```

2. `(assets) => {}` - Run this specified callback against assets added later by plugins.

   ```js
   compilation.hooks.processAssets.tap(
     {
       name: 'MyPlugin',
       stage: Compilation.PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_DEV_TOOLING,
       additionalAssets: (assets) => {
         // this callback will run against assets added later by plugins.
       },
     },
     (assets) => {
       // code
     }
   );
   ```

Here's a list of stages we can use:

- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_ADDITIONAL` - Add additional assets to the compilation.
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_PRE_PROCESS` - Basic preprocessing of the assets.
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_DERIVED` - Derive new assets from the existing assets.
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_ADDITIONS` - Add additional sections to the existing assets e.g. banner or initialization code.
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_OPTIMIZE` - Optimize existing assets in a general way.
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_OPTIMIZE_COUNT` - Optimize the count of existing assets, e.g. by merging them.
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_OPTIMIZE_COMPATIBILITY` - Optimize the compatibility of existing assets, e.g. add polyfills or vendor prefixes.
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_OPTIMIZE_SIZE` - Optimize the size of existing assets, e.g. by minimizing or omitting whitespace.
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_DEV_TOOLING` - Add development tooling to the assets, e.g. by extracting a source map.
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_OPTIMIZE_INLINE` <Badge text='5.8.0+' /> - Optimize the numbers of existing assets, e.g. by inlining assets into other assets.
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_SUMMARIZE` - Summarize the list of existing assets.
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_OPTIMIZE_HASH` - Optimize the hashes of the assets, e.g. by generating real hashes of the asset content.
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_OPTIMIZE_TRANSFER` - Optimize the transfer of existing assets, e.g. by preparing a compressed (gzip) file as separate asset.
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_ANALYSE` - Analyze the existing assets.
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_REPORT` - Creating assets for the reporting purposes.

### `afterProcessAssets`
