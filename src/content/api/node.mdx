Webpack provides a Node.js API which can be used directly in Node.js runtime.

The Node.js API is useful in scenarios in which you need to customize the build or development process since all the reporting and error handling must be done manually and webpack only does the compiling part. For this reason the [`stats`](/configuration/stats) configuration options will not have any effect in the `webpack()` call.

## Installation

To start using the webpack Node.js API, first install webpack if you haven’t yet:

```bash
npm install --save-dev webpack
```

Then require the webpack module in your Node.js script:

```js
const webpack = require('webpack');
```

Or if you prefer ES2015:

```js
import webpack from 'webpack';
```

## webpack()

The imported `webpack` function is fed a webpack [Configuration Object](/configuration/) and runs the webpack compiler if a callback function is provided:

```js-with-links
const webpack = require('webpack');

webpack({
  // [Configuration Object](/configuration/)
}, (err, stats) => { // [Stats Object](#stats-object)
  if (err || stats.hasErrors()) {
    // [Handle errors here](#error-handling)
  }
  // Done processing
});
```

T> The `err` object **will not** include compilation errors. Those must be handled separately using `stats.hasErrors()`, which will be covered in detail in the [Error Handling](#error-handling) section of this guide. The `err` object will only contain webpack-related issues, such as misconfiguration, etc.

T> You can provide the `webpack` function with an array of configurations. See
the [MultiCompiler](#multicompiler) section below for more information.

## Compiler Instance

If you don’t pass the `webpack` runner function a callback, it will return a
webpack `Compiler` instance. This instance can be used to manually trigger the
webpack runner or have it build and watch for changes, much like the
[CLI](/api/cli/). The `Compiler` instance provides the following methods:

- `.run(callback)`
- `.watch(watchOptions, handler)`

Typically, only one master `Compiler` instance is created, although child
compilers can be created in order to delegate specific tasks. The `Compiler` is
ultimately a function which performs bare minimum functionality to keep a
lifecycle running. It delegates all the loading, bundling, and writing work to
registered plugins.

The `hooks` property on a `Compiler` instance is used to register a plugin to
any hook event in the `Compiler`'s lifecycle. The
[`WebpackOptionsDefaulter`](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/master/lib/WebpackOptionsDefaulter.js)
and [`WebpackOptionsApply`](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/master/lib/WebpackOptionsApply.js)
utilities are used by webpack to configure its `Compiler` instance with all the
built-in plugins.

The `run` method is then used to kickstart all compilation work. Upon
completion, the given `callback` function is executed. The final logging of
stats and errors should be done in this `callback` function.

W> The API only supports a single concurrent compilation at a time. When using `run` or
`watch`, call `close` and wait for it to finish before calling `run` or `watch`
again. Concurrent compilations will corrupt the output files.

## Run

Calling the `run` method on the `Compiler` instance is much like the quick run
method mentioned above:

```js-with-links
const webpack = require('webpack');

const compiler = webpack({
  // [Configuration Object](/configuration/)
});

compiler.run((err, stats) => { // [Stats Object](#stats-object)
  // ...

  compiler.close((closeErr) => {
    // ...
  });
});
```

W> Don't forget to close the compiler, so that low-priority work (like persistent caching) have the opportunity to complete.

## Watching

Calling the `watch` method triggers the webpack runner, but then watches for
changes (much like CLI: `webpack --watch`), as soon as webpack detects a
change, runs again. Returns an instance of `Watching`.

```js
watch(watchOptions, callback);
```

```js-with-links
const webpack = require('webpack');

const compiler = webpack({
  // [Configuration Object](/configuration/)
});

const watching = compiler.watch({
  // Example [watchOptions](/configuration/watch/#watchoptions)
  aggregateTimeout: 300,
  poll: undefined
}, (err, stats) => { // [Stats Object](#stats-object)
  // Print watch/build result here...
  console.log(stats);
});
```

`Watching` options are covered in detail
[here](/configuration/watch/#watchoptions).

W> Filesystem inaccuracies may trigger multiple builds for a single change.
In the example above, the `console.log` statement may fire multiple times for a
single modification. Users should expect this behavior and may check
`stats.hash` to see if the file hash has actually changed.

### Close `Watching`

The `watch` method returns a `Watching` instance that exposes
`.close(callback)` method. Calling this method will end watching:

```js
watching.close((closeErr) => {
  console.log('Watching Ended.');
});
```

W> It’s not allowed to watch or run again before the existing watcher has been
closed or invalidated.

### Invalidate `Watching`

Using `watching.invalidate`, you can manually invalidate the current compiling
round, without stopping the watch process:

```js
watching.invalidate();
```

## Stats Object

The `stats` object that is passed as a second argument of the
[`webpack()`](#webpack) callback, is a good source of information about the
code compilation process. It includes:

- Errors and Warnings (if any)
- Timings
- Module and Chunk information

The [webpack CLI](/api/cli) uses this information to display nicely formatted
output in your console.

T> When using the [`MultiCompiler`](#multicompiler), a
`MultiStats` instance is returned that fulfills the same interface as `stats`,
i.e. the methods described below.

This `stats` object exposes the following methods:

### stats.hasErrors()

Can be used to check if there were errors while compiling. Returns `true` or
`false`.

### stats.hasWarnings()

Can be used to check if there were warnings while compiling. Returns `true` or
`false`.

### stats.toJson(options)

Returns compilation information as a JSON object. `options` can be either a
string (a preset) or an object for more granular control:

```js-with-links
stats.toJson('minimal'); // [more options: 'verbose', etc](/configuration/stats).
```

```js
stats.toJson({
  assets: false,
  hash: true,
});
```

All available options and presets are described in the stats [documentation](/configuration/stats).

> Here’s an [example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webpack/analyse/master/app/pages/upload/example2.json)
> of this function’s output.

### stats.toString(options)

Returns a formatted string of the compilation information (similar to
[CLI](/api/cli) output).

Options are the same as [`stats.toJson(options)`](/api/node/#statstojsonoptions) with one addition:

```js
stats.toString({
  // Add console colors
  colors: true,
});
```

Here’s an example of `stats.toString()` usage:

```js-with-links
const webpack = require('webpack');

webpack({
  // [Configuration Object](/configuration/)
}, (err, stats) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return;
  }

  console.log(stats.toString({
    chunks: false,  // Makes the build much quieter
    colors: true    // Shows colors in the console
  }));
});
```

## MultiCompiler

The `MultiCompiler` module allows webpack to run multiple configurations in
separate compilers. If the `options` parameter in the webpack's NodeJS api is
an array of options, webpack applies separate compilers and calls the
`callback` after all compilers have been executed.

```js-with-links
var webpack = require('webpack');

webpack([
  { entry: './index1.js', output: { filename: 'bundle1.js' } },
  { entry: './index2.js', output: { filename: 'bundle2.js' } }
], (err, stats) => { // [Stats Object](#stats-object)
  process.stdout.write(stats.toString() + '\n');
})
```

W> Multiple configurations will **not be run in parallel**. Each
configuration is only processed after the previous one has finished
processing. To process them in parallel, you can use a third-party solution
like [parallel-webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parallel-webpack).

## Error Handling

For good error handling, you need to account for these three types of errors:

- Fatal webpack errors (wrong configuration, etc)
- Compilation errors (missing modules, syntax errors, etc)
- Compilation warnings

Here’s an example that does all that:

```js-with-links
const webpack = require('webpack');

webpack({
  // [Configuration Object](/configuration/)
}, (err, stats) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err.stack || err);
    if (err.details) {
      console.error(err.details);
    }
    return;
  }

  const info = stats.toJson();

  if (stats.hasErrors()) {
    console.error(info.errors);
  }

  if (stats.hasWarnings()) {
    console.warn(info.warnings);
  }

  // Log result...
});
```

## Custom File Systems

By default, webpack reads files and writes files to disk using a normal file
system. However, it is possible to change the input or output behavior using a
different kind of file system (memory, webDAV, etc). To accomplish this, one
can change the `inputFileSystem` or `outputFileSystem`. For example, you can
replace the default `outputFileSystem` with
[`memfs`](https://github.com/streamich/memfs) to write files to memory
instead of to disk:

```js
const { createFsFromVolume, Volume } = require('memfs');
const webpack = require('webpack');

const fs = createFsFromVolume(new Volume());
const compiler = webpack({
  /* options */
});

compiler.outputFileSystem = fs;
compiler.run((err, stats) => {
  // Read the output later:
  const content = fs.readFileSync('...');
  compiler.close((closeErr) => {
    // ...
  });
});
```

Note that this is what
[webpack-dev-middleware](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware),
used by [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server)
and many other packages, uses to mysteriously hide your files but continue
serving them up to the browser!

T> The output file system you provide needs to be compatible with Node’s own
[`fs`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) interface, which requires the `mkdirp`
and `join` helper methods.
