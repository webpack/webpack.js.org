Resolvers are created using the `enhanced-resolve` package. The `Resolver`
class extends the `tapable` class and uses `tapable` to provide a few hooks.
The `enhanced-resolve` package can be used directly to create new resolvers,
however any [`compiler` instance](/api/node/#compiler-instance) has a few resolver instances that can be
tapped into.

Before reading on, make sure to have a look at the
[`enhanced-resolve`](https://github.com/webpack/enhanced-resolve) and [`tapable`](/api/plugins/#tapable) documentation.

## Types

There are three types of built-in resolvers available on the `compiler` class:

- `normal`: Resolves a module via an absolute or relative path.
- `context`: Resolves a module within a given context.
- `loader`: Resolves a webpack [loader](/loaders).

Depending on need, any one of these built-in resolvers, that are used by the `compiler`,
can be customized via plugins:

```js
compiler.resolverFactory.hooks.resolver
  .for('[type]')
  .tap('name', (resolver) => {
    // you can tap into resolver.hooks now
    resolver.hooks.result.tap('MyPlugin', (result) => {
      return result;
    });
  });
```

Where `[type]` is one of the three resolvers mentioned above.

See the [`enhanced-resolve` documentation](https://github.com/webpack/enhanced-resolve) for a full list of hooks and their description.

## Configuration Options

The resolvers mentioned above can also be customized via a configuration file
with the [`resolve`](/configuration/resolve/) or [`resolveLoader`](/configuration/resolve/#resolveloader) options. These options allow
users to change the resolving behavior through a variety of options including
through resolve `plugins`.

The resolver plugins, e.g. [`DirectoryNamedPlugin`](https://github.com/shaketbaby/directory-named-webpack-plugin), can be included
directly in `resolve.plugins` rather than using directly in [`plugins` configuration option](/configuration/plugins/#plugins).

T> Note that the `resolve` configuration affects the `normal` and `context` resolvers while `resolveLoader` is used to modify the `loader` resolver.
