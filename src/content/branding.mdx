Here you can find **webpack** project brand guidelines, assets, and license.

## The Name

Webpack can be written with a capital W when used at the start of a sentence, otherwise it should be written in lower-case letters.

## Logo

The webpack logo should be placed on a white background with enough space around it like this:

<img
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webpack/media/master/logo/logo-on-white-bg.png"
  alt="webpack logo default with proper spacing on light background"
/>

Double the size of the inner dark blue cube to get an idea how much space the logo should have.

For dark backgrounds, you can use the negative version of the logo:

export const style = {
  display: 'block',
  background: '#111',
};

<div style={style}>
  <img
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webpack/media/master/logo/logo-on-dark-bg.png"
    alt="webpack logo default with proper spacing on light background"
  />
</div>

T> Please use the **icon + text** whenever possible.

## Icon only

**The icon is designed to be used in layout-constrained areas. As previously stated, please prefer icon + text.**

<img

  width="250"
  alt="icon example"
/>

Square-sized icon for bigger areas (like avatars or profile pictures):

<img
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webpack/media/master/logo/icon-square-big.png"
  width="250"
  alt="icon square big example"
/>

Square-sized icon for smaller areas (like favicons):

<img
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webpack/media/master/logo/icon-square-small.png"
  width="50"
  alt="icon square small example"
/>

T> For those of you following our guidelines and have gotten this far, we've made a smaller size image used especially for custom emoji (like in a slack or gitter channel ;))
