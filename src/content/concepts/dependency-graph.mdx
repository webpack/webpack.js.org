Any time one file depends on another, webpack treats this as a _dependency_. This allows webpack to take non-code assets, such as images or web fonts, and also provide them as _dependencies_ for your application.

When webpack processes your application, it starts from a list of modules defined on the command line or in its configuration file.
Starting from these [_entry points_](/concepts/entry-points/), webpack recursively builds a _dependency graph_ that includes every module your application needs, then bundles all of those modules into a small number of _bundles_ - often, only one - to be loaded by the browser.

T> Bundling your application is especially powerful for _HTTP/1.1_ clients, as it minimizes the number of times your app has to wait while the browser starts a new request. For _HTTP/2_, you can also use [Code Splitting](/guides/code-splitting/) to achieve best results.
