A resolver is a library which helps in locating a module by its absolute path.
A module can be required as a dependency from another module as:

```js
import foo from 'path/to/module';
// or
require('path/to/module');
```

The dependency module can be from the application code or a third-party library. The resolver helps
webpack find the module code that needs to be included in the bundle for every such `require`/`import` statement.
webpack uses [enhanced-resolve](https://github.com/webpack/enhanced-resolve) to resolve file paths while bundling modules.

## Resolving rules in webpack

Using `enhanced-resolve`, webpack can resolve three kinds of file paths:

### Absolute paths

```js
import '/home/me/file';

import 'C:\\Users\\me\\file';
```

Since we already have the absolute path to the file, no further resolution is required.

### Relative paths

```js
import '../src/file1';
import './file2';
```

In this case, the directory of the resource file where the `import` or `require` occurs is taken to be the context directory. The relative path specified in the `import/require` is joined to this context path to produce the absolute path to the module.

### Module paths

```js
import 'module';
import 'module/lib/file';
```

Modules are searched for inside all directories specified in [`resolve.modules`](/configuration/resolve/#resolvemodules).
You can replace the original module path by an alternate path by creating an alias for it using the [`resolve.alias`](/configuration/resolve/#resolvealias) configuration option.

- If the package contains a `package.json` file, then fields specified in [`resolve.exportsFields`](/configuration/resolve/#resolveexportsfields) configuration options are looked up in order, and the first such field in `package.json` determines the available exports from the package according to the [package exports guideline](/guides/package-exports/).

Once the path is resolved based on the above rule, the resolver checks to see if the path points to a file or a directory. If the path points to a file:

- If the path has a file extension, then the file is bundled straightaway.
- Otherwise, the file extension is resolved using the [`resolve.extensions`](/configuration/resolve/#resolveextensions) option, which tells the resolver which extensions are acceptable for resolution e.g. `.js`, `.jsx`.

If the path points to a folder, then the following steps are taken to find the right file with the right extension:

- If the folder contains a `package.json` file, then fields specified in [`resolve.mainFields`](/configuration/resolve/#resolvemainfields) configuration option are looked up in order, and the first such field in `package.json` determines the file path.
- If there is no `package.json` or if the [`resolve.mainFields`](/configuration/resolve/#resolvemainfields) do not return a valid path, file names specified in the [`resolve.mainFiles`](/configuration/resolve/#resolvemainfiles) configuration option are looked for in order, to see if a matching filename exists in the imported/required directory.
- The file extension is then resolved in a similar way using the [`resolve.extensions`](/configuration/resolve/#resolveextensions) option.

webpack provides reasonable [defaults](/configuration/resolve) for these options depending on your build target.

## Resolving Loaders

This follows the same rules as those specified for file resolution. But the [`resolveLoader`](/configuration/resolve/#resolveloader) configuration option can be used to have separate resolution rules for loaders.

## Caching

Every filesystem access is cached so that multiple parallel or serial requests to the same file occur faster. In [watch mode](/configuration/watch/#watch), only modified files are evicted from the cache. If watch mode is off, then the cache gets purged before every compilation.

See [Resolve API](/configuration/resolve) to learn more about the configuration options mentioned above.
