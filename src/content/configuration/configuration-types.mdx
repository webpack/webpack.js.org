Besides exporting a single configuration object, there are a few more ways that cover other needs as well.

## Exporting a Function

Eventually you will find the need to disambiguate in your `webpack.config.js` between [development](/guides/development) and [production builds](/guides/production). There are multiple ways to do that. One option is to export a function from your webpack configuration instead of exporting an object. The function will be invoked with two arguments:

- An environment as the first parameter. See the [environment options CLI documentation](/api/cli/#environment-options) for syntax examples.
- An options map (`argv`) as the second parameter. This describes the options passed to webpack, with keys such as [`output-path`](/api/cli/#flags) and [`mode`](/api/cli/#flags).

```diff
-module.exports = {
+module.exports = function(env, argv) {
+  return {
+    mode: env.production ? 'production' : 'development',
+    devtool: env.production ? 'source-map' : 'eval',
     plugins: [
       new TerserPlugin({
         terserOptions: {
+          compress: argv.mode === 'production' // only if `--mode production` was passed
         }
       })
     ]
+  };
};
```

## Exporting a Promise

Webpack will run the function exported by the configuration file and wait for a Promise to be returned. Handy when you need to asynchronously load configuration variables.

T> It is possible to export multiple promises by wrapping them into `Promise.all([/* Your promises */]).`

```js
module.exports = () => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve({
        entry: './app.js',
        /* ... */
      });
    }, 5000);
  });
};
```

W> Returning a `Promise` only works when using webpack via CLI. [`webpack()`](/api/node/#webpack) expects an object.

## Exporting multiple configurations

Instead of exporting a single configuration object/function, you may export multiple configurations (multiple functions are supported since webpack 3.1.0). When running webpack, all configurations are built. For instance, this is useful for [bundling a library](/guides/author-libraries) for multiple [targets](/configuration/output/#outputlibrarytarget) such as AMD and CommonJS:

```js
module.exports = [
  {
    output: {
      filename: './dist-amd.js',
      libraryTarget: 'amd',
    },
    name: 'amd',
    entry: './app.js',
    mode: 'production',
  },
  {
    output: {
      filename: './dist-commonjs.js',
      libraryTarget: 'commonjs',
    },
    name: 'commonjs',
    entry: './app.js',
    mode: 'production',
  },
];
```

T> If you pass a name to [`--config-name`](/api/cli/#config-name) flag, webpack will only build that specific configuration.

### parallelism

In case you export multiple configurations, you can use `parallelism` option on the configuration array to specify the maximum number of compilers that will compile in parallel.

- Type: `number`
- Available: 5.22.0+

**webpack.config.js**

```javascript
module.exports = [
  {
    //config-1
  },
  {
    //config-2
  },
];
module.exports.parallelism = 1;
```
