Out of the box, webpack won't require you to use a configuration file. However, it will assume the entry point of your project is `src/index.js` and will output the result in `dist/main.js` minified and optimized for production.

T> [createapp.dev](https://createapp.dev/webpack) is an online tool for creating custom webpack configurations. It allows you to select various features that will be combined and added to the resulting configuration file. Also, it generates an example project based on provided webpack configuration that you can review in your browser and download.

Usually, your projects will need to extend this functionality, for this you can create a `webpack.config.js` file in the root folder and webpack will automatically use it.

All the available configuration options are specified below.

## Use a different configuration file

If for some reason you want to use a different configuration file depending on certain situations, you can change this via command line by using the `--config` flag.

**package.json**

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "webpack --config prod.config.js"
}
```

## Set up a new webpack project

W> webpack applies configuration defaults after [plugins defaults](/contribute/writing-a-plugin/#configuration-defaults) are applied.

Webpack has a huge set of options which might be overwhelming to you, please take advantage of [webpack-cli's `init` command](/api/cli/#init) which could rapidly generate webpack configuration files for your project requirements, it will ask you a couple of questions before creating a configuration file.

```bash
npx webpack init
```

npx might prompt you to install `@webpack-cli/generators` if it is not yet installed in the project or globally. You might also get additional packages installed to your project depending on the choices you've made during the configuration generation.

```bash
$ npx webpack init

[webpack-cli] For using this command you need to install: '@webpack-cli/generators' package.
