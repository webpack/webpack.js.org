Out of the box, webpack won't require you to use a configuration file. However, it will assume the entry point of your project is `src/index.js` and will output the result in `dist/main.js` minified and optimized for production.

Usually, your projects will need to extend this functionality, for this you can create a `webpack.config.js` file in the root folder and webpack will automatically use it.

All the available configuration options are specified below.

## Use a different configuration file

If for some reason you want to use a different configuration file depending on certain situations, you can change this via command line by using the `--config` flag.

**package.json**

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "webpack --config prod.config.js"
}
```

## Set up a new webpack project

W> webpack applies configuration defaults after [plugins defaults](/contribute/writing-a-plugin/#configuration-defaults) are applied.

Webpack has a huge set of options which might be overwhelming to you, please take advantage of [webpack-cli's `init` command](/api/cli/#init) which could rapidly generate webpack configuration files for your project requirements, it will ask you a couple of questions before creating a configuration file.

```bash
npx webpack init
```

npx might prompt you to install `@webpack-cli/generators` if it is not yet installed in the project or globally. You might also get additional packages installed to your project depending on the choices you've made during the configuration generation.

```bash
$ npx webpack init

[webpack-cli] For using this command you need to install: '@webpack-cli/generators' package.
