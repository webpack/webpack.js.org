The `plugins` option is used to customize the webpack build process in a variety of ways. webpack comes with a variety built-in plugins available under `webpack.[plugin-name]`. See [Plugins page](/plugins) for a list of plugins and documentation but note that there are a lot more out in the community.

T> Note: This page only discusses using plugins, however if you are interested in writing your own please visit [Writing a Plugin](/contribute/writing-a-plugin/).

## `plugins`

[`[Plugin]`](/plugins/)

An array of webpack plugins. For example, [`DefinePlugin`](/plugins/define-plugin/) allows you to create global constants which can be configured at compile time. This can be useful for allowing different behavior between development builds and release builds.

**webpack.config.js**

```js
module.exports = {
  //...
  plugins: [
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      // Definitions...
    }),
  ],
};
```

A more complex example, using multiple plugins, might look something like this:

**webpack.config.js**

```js
var webpack = require('webpack');
// importing plugins that do not come by default in webpack
var DashboardPlugin = require('webpack-dashboard/plugin');

// adding plugins to your configuration
module.exports = {
  //...
  plugins: [
    new webpack.IgnorePlugin(/^\.\/locale$/, /moment$/),
    // compile time plugins
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env.NODE_ENV': '"production"',
    }),
    // webpack-dev-server enhancement plugins
    new DashboardPlugin(),
    new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin(),
  ],
};
```
