All participants in the webpack project must follow the
[Code of Conduct][]. There are further expectations for members of the [TSC][].

When decisions are made within the established guidelines and policies of the
project, those in leadership roles have a responsibility to uphold and respect
the decision even if they disagree with it. This is especially important in
external communications, for example in social media. Should the member be
unwilling or unable to do so, then they should resign their leadership position.
This does not mean that decisions cannot be revisited and discussed within the
team at a later time.

Everyone participating in the webpack project must conduct themselves in
a professional and respectful manner in accordance with our
[Code of Conduct][]. In addition, some general guidelines for
leadership group members include:

- Remediate quickly when you realize you made a mistake. Leaders are human,
  and they will make mistakes. However they should act swiftly to
  acknowledge mistakes and correct them.
- Aim to remediate first and then discuss.  If other members of the
  team express concerns about actions, acknowledge their concerns by
  stopping the actions in question and then discuss within the team
  to come to a common agreement.
- Treat all community members with respect, consideration, and highest
  standards of ethical conduct.
- Value a diversity of views and opinions. Avoid preferential
  treatment, and hold everyone (including ourselves) accountable to the same
  set of standards.  Everyone gets to speak up.
- Deal with issues directly with the person in question. Resist complaining
  about others in the project in a public sphere.
- Build trust by keeping your promises.
- Be the model of accountability and leadership. Provide the example of
  ownership and stewardship that everyone can follow to success.
- Commit to ongoing development and learning best practices for governing.
- Criticize ideas rather than people, discussing any concerns in person
  whenever possible, and taking responsibility for our statements.

While the guidelines above focus primarily on the spaces where
we participate in official foundation work (GitHub, IRC, meetings,
conferences), it is important to recognize that the public behavior
of members also reflects on the webpack project.

If you're interested in an introduction to diversity, inclusion, and unconscious bias,
[try this free training offered by our partners at the Linux Foundation](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/linux-courses/open-source-compliance-courses/inclusive-speaker-orientation).

If it appears that any member of the project leadership is acting outside
of the expectations set above please refer to our [moderation policy](./MODERATION_POLICY.md)
which outlines the process of making an official complaint.
