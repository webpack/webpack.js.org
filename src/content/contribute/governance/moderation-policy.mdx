## Moderation policy

If you are not a member of the webpack GitHub Organization and wish to submit a
moderation request, please see [Requesting Moderation][]

- [Applicability][]
- [Terms][]
- [Grounds for Moderation][]
- [Requesting Moderation][]
- [Consideration of Intent][]
- [Guidelines and Requirements][]
  - [Collaborator Posts][]
  - [Non-Collaborator Posts][]
  - [Temporary Interaction Limits][]

## Applicability

This policy applies to all repositories under the `webpack` and `webpack-contrib`
GitHub Organizations and all webpack Working Groups. This policy also
applies to the [webpack Slack Community](https://webpack.slack.com),
supported by the Admin team of the Slack organization.

## Terms

- _Collaborator_ refers to any individual with configured triage role or higher
  in any webpack GitHub organizations repositories. See
  [GitHub's Repository roles documentation][] for more information.
- _TSC_ refers to the [webpack Technical Steering Committee][].
- _Post_ refers to the content and titles of any issue, pull request, comment,
  discussion, or wiki page.
- _Moderate_ means to modify, lock, or delete one or more Posts to correct or
  address Code of Conduct violations.
- _Remove_ refers to the act of removing the configured write (commit)
  permissions for an individual Collaborator's GitHub account from _all_
  webpack GitHub Organizations repositories as well as removing the account from
  the webpack GitHub Organizations membership.
- _Block_ refers to the act of prohibiting an individual GitHub account from any
  further participation in the webpack GitHub Organizations. A block may be
  _temporary_ or _indefinite_.
  - This Moderation Policy applies only to blocking from the organization.
    Individuals may choose to
    [block other individuals from their personal GitHub accounts][]. This policy
    does not restrict blocking from personal GitHub accounts.
- _Requester_ refers to an individual requesting Moderation on a Post.

## Grounds for Moderation

Any Post in violation of the webpack [Code of Conduct][] is subject
to Moderation.

The TSC is responsible for deciding what constitutes inappropriate
behavior that may be subject to Moderation.

## Requesting Moderation

Anyone may request Moderation of a Post. Requesting Moderation of a Post can be
accomplished in one of four ways:

- Via the [webpack-security@openjsf.org][] email address,
- Via private email to individual TSC members,
- Via a new Post in the same thread as the Post being requested for Moderation,
- Via a new Post in the private webpack/moderation repository.

Note that Collaborators may Moderate non-Collaborator Posts at any time without
submitting an initial request (see: [Non-Collaborator Posts][]).

Use of the [webpack-security@openjsf.org][] email address -- or private email to individual
TSC members -- is appropriate when the individual requesting the
Moderation does not feel comfortable directly or publicly making the request.
All emails sent to the [webpack-security@openjsf.org][] address are currently forwarded
to all members of the TSC.

Requests should contain as much information and context as possible, including
the URL and a screenshot of the Post in question. Screenshots may be modified
to obscure obscene or offensive content.

External public venues or social media services such as Twitter must never be
used to request Moderation.

Collaborators must never discuss the specific details of a Moderation request
in any public forum or any social media service outside of the webpack GitHub
Organization.

Note that quoting the original content of a Post within a Moderation request or
webpack/moderation repository issue is not a violation of the
[Code of Conduct][]. However, discretion is advised when including such quotes
in requests posted to public repositories.

Requests for Moderation that do not appear to have been submitted in good faith
with intent to address a legitimate [Code of Conduct][] violation will be
ignored.

## Consideration of Intent

Before Moderating a Post, Collaborators should carefully consider the possible
intent of the author. It may be that the author has simply made an error or is
not yet familiar with the [Code of Conduct][]; or it may be that cultural
differences exist, or that the author is unaware that certain content is
inappropriate. In such cases, the author should be given an
opportunity to correct any error that may have been made.

Note, however, that unfamiliarity with the [Code of Conduct][] does not excuse
a Post from Moderation.

## Guidelines and Requirements

- All Posts are expected to respect the webpack [Code of Conduct][].
- Any Collaborator with triage permission to a given repository (except
  webpack/moderation) may Moderate Posts within that repository's issue tracker.
  Only the TSC is allowed to moderate posts on webpack/moderation.
- The TSC serves as the final arbiter for all Moderation issues.
- TSC members may Remove or Block an individual from the webpack
  GitHub Organizations.
- For any Removal or Blocking action, an issue describing the reasons for the
  action, and identifying the Github account being acted upon, must be posted
  to the Moderation Repository with an explanation provided by the Moderation
  Team member performing the action.
- Any individual Blocked from the webpack GitHub Organizations will be recommended
  for exclusion from any webpack Foundation sponsored event or activity.
- Minor edits to the formatting of a Post or to correct typographical errors
  are not "Moderation". Such edits and their intent must
  still be documented with a short note indicating who made the edit and why.

### Collaborator Posts

- Prior to Moderating any Post authored by a Collaborator, the author must be
  given a reasonable opportunity to modify or remove the Post on their own.
- If the author of the Post disagrees that Moderation is required, the matter
  can be escalated to the TSC for resolution. In such cases, no Moderation
  action may be taken until a decision by the TSC is made.
- When Moderating any Post authored by another Collaborator, the moderating
  Collaborator must:
  - Explain the justification for Moderating the post,
  - Identify all changes made to the Post, and
  - Identify the steps previously taken to resolve the issue.
  - If the Moderation action included Blocking, an indication of whether the Block
    is temporary or indefinite is required, along with an issue posted to the
    moderation repository justifying the action.
- Explanations of Moderation actions on Collaborator Posts must be provided in:
  - A new post within the original thread, or
  - A new issue within the private webpack/moderation repository.
- Any Collaborator habitually violating the Code of Conduct or this Moderation
  policy may be Blocked temporarily or, in extreme cases, Removed and Blocked
  indefinitely.

### Non-Collaborator Posts

- Posts authored by non-Collaborators are always subject to immediate Moderation
  by any Collaborator if the content is intentionally disruptive or in violation
  of the [Code of Conduct][].
- When moderating non-Collaborator posts, the moderating Collaborator must:
  - Explain the justification for Moderating the post, and
  - Identify all changes made to the Post.
  - If the Moderation action included Blocking, an indication of whether the Block
    is temporary or indefinite is required, along with a note justifying the
    action.
- If an explanation of a Moderation action for a non-Collaborator Post is
  provided, it must be provided in:
  - The original Post being modified (as replacement or appended content),
  - A new post within the original thread, or
  - A new issue within the private webpack/moderation repository.
- Moderation of Posts authored by non-Collaborators may result in those
  non-Collaborators being Blocked temporarily or indefinitely from further
  participation in the webpack GitHub organizations.
- If it is clear that there is no intention to collaborate in good faith,
  it is possible to hide comments of non-Collaborators. In that case there is
  an exception to the reporting requirement described above.
- Accounts that are reasonably believed to be bots (other than bots authorized
  by the TSC) are subject to immediate Blocking.
- Issues, pull requests, discussions, and comments that are spam (job posting,
  service advertising, etc.) are subject to immediate moderation.
- Issues, pull requests, discussions, and comments that are believed to be
  LLM-generated (e.g a PR coming from a new contributor changing a single file
  without clear motivation) should be closed with a comment such as "It seems
  you are using a LLM, please stop, this is not bringing any value and is
  wasting our time. If you are not using one, please read and follow our
  contributing guidelines." Report the user to the moderation repository so they
  get blocked if they do it again.
- Collaborators may use the Hide feature in the GitHub interface for off-topic
  posts by non-Collaborators.
- TSC members can delete any issues or comments posted by accounts that have
  been deleted by GitHub. These accounts show up in the GitHub interface as
  user `ghost`. There is no need to screenshot or document these deletions.

There are a few examples of moderating non-Collaborator posts:

Scenario 1:

- A non-Collaborator posts a comment that indicates that they are a bot.
- A collaborator sees the post and hides it.
- No further action is necessary.

Scenario 2:

- A non-Collaborator posts a comment that is against the Code of Conduct.
- A Collaborator sees the comment and asks the author to edit it.
- The author refuses to edit their comment.
- The Collaborator deletes the comment and posts an issue in the moderation
  repository explaining their actions.

Scenario 3:

- A non-Collaborator opens a pull request with comments indicating they are a
  bot.
- A Collaborator sees that pull requests, closes it, deletes the comments
  and posts an issue in the moderation repository explaining their actions.
- A TSC member sees the issue and decides to block the user from the
  organization.

Scenario 4:

- A non-Collaborator posts a comment on an old commit that is against the
  Code of Conduct.
- A Collaborator sees the comment, takes a screenshot, and deletes it.
- The Collaborator posts an issue in the moderation repository explaining
  their actions.

### Temporary Interaction Limits

The TSC may, at their discretion, choose to enable [GitHub's
Temporary Interaction Limits][] on any GitHub repository in the webpack GitHub
Organization.

Any Collaborator may request that the TSC enable the Temporary
Interaction Limits by posting an issue to the moderation repository. If the
TSC chooses not to do so, then a comment explaining why that decision was made
must be added to the moderation repository thread.

### Temporary and Indefinite Blocks

A Temporary Block is time limited, with the timeframe decided on by the Moderation
Team at the time of issuing, depending on the severity of the issue. Recommended
default options are 24-hour, 48-hour, and 7-day periods.

An Indefinite Block is set for an unspecified period of time and may only be
lifted for an individual through a simple majority vote of the Moderation
Team.

## Privacy of the webpack/moderation Repository

The webpack/moderation Repository is used to discuss the potentially sensitive
details of any specific moderation issue. The repository is private but
accessible to all Collaborators. The details of any issue discussed within the
webpack/moderation repository are expected to remain confidential and are not to
be discussed in any public forum or social media service.

Any Collaborator found to be violating the privacy of the webpack/moderation
repository by repeatedly sharing or discussing the details of webpack/moderation
issues in any public forum or social media service risks being permanently
removed from the webpack GitHub organizations.

## Escalation of Issues

Moderation issue disputes not involving a TSC member may be escalated
to the TSC for review by tagging the
original issue, pull request, or associated webpack/moderation repository.
Any such Moderation action may be overturned through a TSC vote.

TSC members directly involved in a Moderation
issue (as either the Requester or author of the Post in question) are
required to recuse themselves from any decisions required to resolve the
issue.

Moderation disputes involving TSC members, including questions of whether a TSC
member has violated the Code of Conduct, _shall_ be referred to an
Independent Mediator selected by the OpenJS Foundation.

## Modifications to This Policy

Modifications to this policy are subject to approval by the TSC.
When modifications are proposed, if there are no objections after
72 hours, the modifications are accepted. If there any objections to
any proposed change, a TSC vote in favor of the change is required.
