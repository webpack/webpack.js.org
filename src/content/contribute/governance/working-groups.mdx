## webpack Working Groups

webpack Working Groups are autonomous projects created by the
[Technical Steering Committee (TSC)][].

Working Groups can be formed at any time but must be ratified by the TSC.
Once formed the work defined in the Working Group charter is the
responsibility of the WG rather than the TSC.

It is important that Working Groups are not formed prematurely. Working
Groups are not formed to begin a set of tasks but instead are formed
once that work is already underway and the contributors
think it would benefit from being done as an autonomous project.

If the work defined in a Working Group's charter is complete, the charter
should be revoked.

A Working Group's charter can be revoked either by consent of the Working
Group's members or by a TSC vote. Once revoked, any future work that arises
becomes the responsibility of the TSC.

## Joining a WG

To find out how to join a working group, consult the [GOVERNANCE.md](https://github.com/webpack/governance/blob/main/README.md) in
the working group's repository.

## Starting a Working Group

A Working Group is established by first defining a charter that can be
ratified by the TSC. A charter is a statement of purpose and a
list of responsibilities. When requesting that a working group be chartered, it
is also necessary to provide a list of initial membership.

A working group needs 3 initial members. These should be individuals
already undertaking the work described in the charter.

The list of responsibilities should be specific. Once established, these
responsibilities are no longer governed by the TSC and therefore should
not be broad or subjective. The only recourse the TSC has over the working
group is to revoke the entire charter.

If the responsibilities described in the charter are currently undertaken by
another working group then the charter will additionally have to be ratified by
that working group.

You can submit the working group charter for ratification by sending
a pull request to this document to add the charter it to the
list of current Working Groups. Once ratified, the list of
members should be maintained in the Working Group's
README.

## Bootstrap Governance

Once the TSC ratifies a charter, the working group inherits the following
documentation for governance, contribution, conduct and an MIT
LICENSE. The working group is free to change these documents through their own
governance process, hence the term "bootstrap."

```markdown
### _[insert WG name]_ Working Group

The webpack _[insert WG name]_ is governed by a Working Group (WG)
that is responsible for high-level guidance of the project.

The WG has final authority over this project including:

- Technical direction
- Project governance and process (including this policy)
- Contribution policy
- GitHub repository hosting
- Conduct guidelines
- Maintaining the list of additional Collaborators

For the current list of WG members, see the project
[README.md](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/README.md#current-project-members).

### Collaborators

The _[insert WG name]_ GitHub repository is
maintained by the WG and additional Collaborators who are added by the
WG on an ongoing basis.

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are made
Collaborators and given commit-access to the project. These
individuals are identified by the WG and their addition as
Collaborators is discussed during the weekly WG meeting.

Modifications of the contents of the _[insert WG repo]_ repository are made on
a collaborative basis. Anybody with a GitHub account may propose a
modification via pull request and it will be considered by the project
Collaborators. All pull requests must be reviewed and accepted by a
Collaborator with sufficient expertise who is able to take full
responsibility for the change. In the case of pull requests proposed
by an existing Collaborator, an additional Collaborator is required
for sign-off. Consensus should be sought if additional Collaborators
participate and there is disagreement around a particular
modification. See _Consensus Seeking Process_ below for further detail
on the consensus model used for governance.

For the current list of Collaborators, see the project
[README.md](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/README.md#current-project-members).

### WG Membership

WG seats are not time-limited. There is no fixed size of the WG.
However, the expected target is between 6 and 12, to ensure adequate
coverage of important areas of expertise, balanced with the ability to
make decisions efficiently.

There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for WG
membership beyond these rules.

The WG may add additional members to the WG by unanimous consensus.

A WG member may be removed from the WG by voluntary resignation, or by
unanimous consensus of all other WG members.

Changes to WG membership should be posted in the agenda, and may be
suggested as any other agenda item (see "WG Meetings" below).

If an addition or removal is proposed during a meeting, and the full
WG is not in attendance to participate, then the addition or removal
is added to the agenda for the subsequent meeting. This is to ensure
that all members are given the opportunity to participate in all
membership decisions. If a WG member is unable to attend a meeting
where a planned membership decision is being made, then their consent
is assumed.

No more than 1/3 of the WG members may be affiliated with the same
employer. If removal or resignation of a WG member, or a change of
employment by a WG member, creates a situation where more than 1/3 of
the WG membership shares an employer, then the situation must be
immediately remedied by the resignation or removal of one or more WG
members affiliated with the over-represented employer(s).

### Consensus Seeking Process

The WG follows a [Consensus Seeking][] decision-making model.

If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus a WG member can call for
either a closing vote or a vote to table the issue to the next
meeting. The call for a vote must be seconded by a majority of the WG
or else the discussion will continue. Simple majority wins.

Note that changes to WG membership require unanimous consensus. See
"WG Membership" above.

## Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

Use of a CLA or DCO is mandatory for all all OpenJS Foundation projects.
The webpack project has chosen to use the DCO 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

- (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
  have the right to submit it under the open source license
  indicated in the file; or

- (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
  of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
  license and I have the right under that license to submit that
  work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
  by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
  permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
  in the file; or

- (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
  person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
  it.

- (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
  are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
  personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
  maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
  this project or the open source license(s) involved.
