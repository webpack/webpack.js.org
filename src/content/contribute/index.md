The people who contribute to webpack do so for the love of open source, our users and ecosystem, and most importantly, pushing the web forward together. Because of our [Open Collective](http://opencollective.com/webpack) model for funding and transparency, we are able to funnel support and funds through contributors, dependent projects, and the contributor and core teams. To make a donation, simply click the button below...

But what is the return on the investment?


## Developers

The biggest core feature we'd like to provide is enjoyable development experience. Developers like you can help by contributing to rich and vibrant documentation, issuing pull requests to help us cover niche use cases, and to help sustain what you love about webpack.

### How Can I Help?

Anybody can help by doing any of the following:

- Ask your employer to use webpack in projects.
- Help us write and maintain the content on this site (see the [writer's guide](/writers-guide)).
- Contribute to the [core repository](https://github.com/webpack/webpack).
- Become a backer or sponsor on [open collective](https://opencollective.com/webpack#support).

### Encouraging Employers

You can ask your employer to improve your workflow by leveraging webpack: an all-in-one tool for fonts, images and image optimization, and json. Explain to them how webpack will attempt to bundle your code and assets the best it can for the smallest file size, leading to speedier sites and applications.

### Your Contributions

Contributing to webpack is not contributing to an exclusive club. You as a developer are contributing to the overall health of downstream projects. Hundreds, if not thousands, of projects depend on webpack and contributing will make the ecosystem better for all users.

The remainder of this section of the site is dedicated to developers such as yourself who would like to become a part of our ever-growing community:

- [Writing a Loader](./writing-a-loader)
- [Writing a Plugin](./writing-a-plugin)
- [Plugin Patterns](./plugin-patterns)
- [Release Process](./release-process)


## Executives

CTO's, VPs, and owners can help too!

<!-- add slides here regarding monetary value/dev time/tooling -->

webpack is an all-in-one tool for bundling your code. It can handle fonts, images, data and more with the help of community-driven plugins and loaders. Having all of your assets be handled by one tool is immensely helpful, as you or your team can spend less time making sure a machine with many moving parts is working correctly and more time building your product.

### Sponsorship

Aside from monetary assistance, companies can support webpack by:

- Providing developers that are not actively working on a project.
- Contributing computing power for improved CI and regression testing.

You can also encourage your developers to contribute to the ecosystem by open-sourcing webpack loaders, plugins and other utilities. And, as mentioned above, we would greatly appreciate any help increasing our CI/CD infrastructure.

### Anyone Else

To anyone else who is interested in helping our mission -- e.g. venture capitalists, government entities, digital agencies, etc. -- we would love for you to work with us, one of the top npm packages, to improve your product! Please don't hesitate to reach out with questions.
