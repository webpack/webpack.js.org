The release process for deploying webpack is actually quite painless. Read through the following steps, so you have a clear understanding of how it's done.

## Pull Requests

When merging pull requests into the `main` branch, select the _Create Merge Commit_ option.

## Releasing

```bash
npm version patch && git push --follow-tags && npm publish
npm version minor && git push --follow-tags && npm publish
npm version major && git push --follow-tags && npm publish
```

_This will increment the package version, commits the changes, cuts a **local tag**, push to github & publish the npm package._

After that go to the github [releases page](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/releases) and write a Changelog for the new tag.
