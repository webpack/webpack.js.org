Asset Modules provide a built-in way to use asset files (fonts, icons, etc.) without configuring additional loaders. Asset Modules provide five new module types:

- `asset/resource` emits a separate file and exports the URL.
- `asset/inline` exports a data URI of the asset.
- `asset/source` exports the source code of the asset.
- `asset/bytes` exports a [`Uint8Array`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array) view of the asset.
- `asset` automatically chooses between exporting a data URI and emitting a separate file.

## Public Path

By default, under the hood, the `asset` type does `__webpack_public_path__ + import.meta`. This means that setting the `output.publicPath` in your config will allow you to override the URL from which the `asset` loads.

### On The Fly Override

If you set the `__webpack_public_path__` in code, the way you need to achieve it so as not to break the `asset` loading logic is to make sure you run it as the first code in your app and not use a function to do so. An example of this would be having a file called `publicPath.js` with contents

```javascript
__webpack_public_path__ = '[https://cdn.url.com](https://cdn.url.com)';
