webpack is capable of adding `nonce` to all scripts that it loads. To activate the feature set a `__webpack_nonce__` variable needs to be included in your entry script. A unique hash based nonce should be generated and provided for each unique page view this is why `__webpack_nonce__` is specified in the entry file and not in the configuration. Please note that `nonce` should always be a base64-encoded string.

## Examples

In the entry file:

```js
// ...
__webpack_nonce__ = 'c29tZSBjb29sIHN0cmluZyB3aWxsIHBvcCB1cCAxMjM=';
// ...
```

## Enabling CSP

Please note that CSPs are not enabled by default. A corresponding header `Content-Security-Policy` or meta tag `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" ...>` needs to be sent with the document to instruct the browser to enable the CSP. Here's an example of what a CSP header including a CDN white-listed URL might look like:

```html
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'
https://trusted.cdn.com;
```

For more information on CSP and `nonce` attribute, please refer to **Further Reading** section at the bottom of this page.

## Trusted Types

Webpack is also capable of using Trusted Types to load dynamically constructed scripts, to adhere to CSP [`require-trusted-types-for`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/require-trusted-types-for) directive restrictions. See [`output.trustedTypes`](/configuration/output/#outputtrustedtypes) configuration option.
