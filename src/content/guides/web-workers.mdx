As of webpack 5, you can use [Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers) without [`worker-loader`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/worker-loader).

## Syntax

```js
new Worker(new URL('./worker.js', import.meta.url));
```

```js
// or customize the chunk name with magic comments
// see https://webpack.js.org/api/module-methods/#magic-comments
new Worker(
  /* webpackChunkName: "foo-worker" */ new URL('./worker.js', import.meta.url)
);
```

The syntax was chosen to allow running code without bundler, it is also available in native ECMAScript modules in the browser.

Note that while the [`Worker` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker/Worker) suggests that `Worker` constructor would accept a string representing the URL of the script, in webpack 5 you can only use `URL` instead.

W> Using a variable in the `Worker` constructor is not supported by webpack. For example, the following code will not work: `const url = new URL('./path/to/worker.ts', import.meta.url); const worker = new Worker(url);`. This is because webpack cannot analyse the syntax statically. It is important to be aware of this limitation when using `Worker` syntax with webpack.

## Example

**src/index.js**

```js
const worker = new Worker(new URL('./deep-thought.js', import.meta.url));
worker.postMessage({
  question:
    'The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything.',
});
worker.onmessage = ({ data: { answer } }) => {
  console.log(answer);
};
```

**src/deep-thought.js**

```js
self.onmessage = ({ data: { question } }) => {
  self.postMessage({
    answer: 42,
  });
};
```

## Node.js

Similar syntax is supported in Node.js (>= 12.17.0):

```js
import { Worker } from 'worker_threads';

new Worker(new URL('./worker.js', import.meta.url));
```

Note that this is only available in ESM. `Worker` in CommonJS syntax is not supported by either webpack or Node.js.
