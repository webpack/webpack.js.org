This guide only shows major changes that affect end users. For more details please see [the changelog](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/releases).

## Node.js v4

If you are still using Node.js v4 or lower, you need to upgrade your Node.js installation to Node.js v6 or higher.

Instructions for upgrading your Node.js version can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10075990/upgrading-node-js-to-latest-version).

## CLI

The CLI has moved to a separate package: webpack-cli. You need to install it before using webpack, see [basic setup](/guides/getting-started/#basic-setup).

The installation guide can be found [here](/guides/installation).

## Update plugins

Many 3rd party plugins need to be updated to the latest versions to be compatible with webpack 4. Links to popular plugins can be found [here](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/awesome-webpack#webpack-plugins).

## mode

Add the new [`mode`](/configuration/mode/) option to your configuration. Set it to `'production'`, `'development'` or `'none'` depending on your configuration type.

**webpack.config.js**

```diff
module.exports = {
  // ...
+  mode: 'production',
}
```

T> The purpose of `'development'` mode and `'production'` mode is different. You can use `webpack-merge` as shown in [production guide](/guides/production/#setup) to optimize configurations.

## Deprecated/Removed plugins

These plugins can be removed from configuration as they are default in production mode:

**webpack.config.js**

```diff
module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
-    new NoEmitOnErrorsPlugin(),
-    new ModuleConcatenationPlugin(),
-    new DefinePlugin({ "process.env.NODE_ENV": JSON.stringify("production") })
-    new UglifyJsPlugin()
  ],
}
```

These plugins are default in development mode

**webpack.config.js**

```diff
module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
-    new NamedModulesPlugin()
  ],
}
```

These plugins were deprecated and are now removed:

**webpack.config.js**

```diff
module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
-    new NoErrorsPlugin(),
-    new NewWatchingPlugin()
  ],
}
```

## CommonsChunkPlugin

The `CommonsChunkPlugin` was removed. Instead the [`optimization.splitChunks`](/configuration/optimization/#optimizationsplitchunks) options can be used.

See documentation of the [`optimization.splitChunks`](/configuration/optimization/#optimizationsplitchunks) for more details. The default configuration may already suit your needs.

T> When generating the HTML from the stats you can use `optimization.splitChunks.chunks: "all"` which is the optimal configuration in most cases.

## import() and CommonJS

When using `import()` to load non-ESM the result has changed in webpack 4. Now you need to access the `default` property to get the value of `module.exports`.

**non-esm.js**

```javascript
module.exports = {
  sayHello: () => {
    console.log('hello world');
  },
};
```

**example.js**

```javascript
function sayHello() {
  import('./non-esm.js').then((module) => {
    module.default.sayHello();
  });
}
```

## json and loaders

When using a custom loader to transform `.json` files you now need to change the module `type`:

**webpack.config.js**

```diff
module.exports = {
  // ...
  rules: [
    {
      test: /config\.json$/,
      loader: 'special-loader',
+     type: 'javascript/auto',
      options: {...}
    }
  ]
};
```

When still using the `json-loader`, it can be removed:

**webpack.config.js**

```diff
module.exports = {
  // ...
  rules: [
    {
-     test: /\.json$/,
-     loader: 'json-loader'
    }
  ]
};
```

## module.loaders

`module.loaders` were deprecated since webpack 2 and are now removed in favor of [`module.rules`](/configuration/module/#rule).
