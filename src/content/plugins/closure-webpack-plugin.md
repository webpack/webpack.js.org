[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/closure-webpack-plugin.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/closure-webpack-plugin)

This plugin supports the use of Google's Closure Tools with webpack.

[Closure-Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/) is a full optimizing compiler and transpiler.
It offers unmatched optimizations, provides type checking and can easily target transpilation to different versions of ECMASCRIPT.

[Closure-Library](https://developers.google.com/closure/library/) is a utility library designed for full compatibility
with Closure-Compiler. 

## Usage example

```js
const ClosurePlugin = require('closure-webpack-plugin');

new ClosurePlugin({mode: 'STANDARD'}, {
  // compiler flags here
  //
  // for debuging help, try these:
  //
  // formatting: 'PRETTY_PRINT'
  // debug: true
})
```

## Options

 * **platform** - `native`, `java` or `javascript`. Controls which version to use of closure-compiler.
     By default the plugin will attempt to automatically choose the fastest option available.
    - `JAVASCRIPT` does not require the JVM to be installed. Not all flags are supported. 
    - `JAVA` utilizes the jvm. Utilizes multiple threads for parsing and results in faster compilation for large builds.
    - `NATIVE` only available on linux or MacOS. Faster compilation times without requiring a JVM.
 * **mode** - `STANDARD` (default), `AGGRESSIVE_BUNDLE` or `NONE`. Controls how the plugin utilizes the compiler.  
    - `STANDARD` mode, closure-compiler is used as a direct replacement for other minifiers as well as most Babel transformations.  
    - `AGGRESSIVE_BUNDLE` mode, the compiler performs additional optimizations of modules to produce a much smaller file, but
is not compatible with all input modules.
    - `NONE` is designed for dev mode without the compiler but still supports closure-library style dependencies.
 * **childCompilations** - boolean or function. Defaults to `false`.
  In order to decrease build times, this plugin by default only operates on the main compilation.
  Plugins such as extract-text-plugin and html-webpack-plugin run as child compilations and
  usually do not need transpilation or minification. You can enable this for all child compilations
  by setting this option to `true`. For specific control, the option can be set to a function which
  will be passed a compilation object.  
  Example: `function(compilation) { return /html-webpack/.test(compilation.name); }`.
  
 * **closureLibraryBase** - (optional) string. Path to the base.js file in Closure-Library.
 * **deps** - (optional) string or Array. Closures style dependency mappings. Typically generated by the
   [depswriter.py script](https://developers.google.com/closure/library/docs/depswriter) included with Closure-Library.
 * **extraDeps** - (optional) Object. Mapping of namespace to file path for closure-library provided namespaces.

## Compiler Flags

The plugin controls several compiler flags. The following flags should not be used in any mode:

 * module_resolution
 * output_wrapper
 * dependency_mode
 * create_source_map
 * module
 * entry_point

## Aggressive Bundle Mode

In this mode, the compiler rewrites CommonJS modules and hoists require calls. Some modules are not compatible with this type of rewritting. In particular, hoisting will cause the following code to execute out of order:

```js
const foo = require('foo');
addPolyfillToFoo(foo);
const bar = require('bar');
```

Aggressive Bundle Mode utilizes a custom runtime in which modules within a chunk file are all included in the same scope.
This avoids [the cost of small modules](https://nolanlawson.com/2016/08/15/the-cost-of-small-modules/).

In Aggressive Bundle Mode, a file can only appear in a single output chunk. Use the [Commons Chunk Plugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/commons-chunk-plugin/) to split duplicated files into a single output chunk.

## Tips for Use
 * Don't use babel - closure-compiler is also a transpiler.
   If you need [features not yet supported](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/ECMAScript6) by closure-compiler, have babel
   only target those features.
