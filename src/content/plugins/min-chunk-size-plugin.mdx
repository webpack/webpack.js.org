Keep chunk size above the specified limit by merging chunks that are smaller than the `minChunkSize`.

```js
new webpack.optimize.MinChunkSizePlugin({
  minChunkSize: 10000, // Minimum number of characters
});
```

## Usage via CLI

This plugin and it's options can also be invoked via the [CLI](/api/cli/):

```bash
webpack --optimize-min-chunk-size 10000
```
