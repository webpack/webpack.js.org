Generate Chrome profile file which includes timings of plugins execution. Outputs `events.json` file by default. It is possible to provide custom file path using `outputPath` option.

> Note : ProfilingPlugin accepts only absolute paths.

## Options

- `outputPath`: An absolute path to a custom output file (json)

## Usage: default

```js
new webpack.debug.ProfilingPlugin();
```

## Usage: custom `outputPath`

```js
new webpack.debug.ProfilingPlugin({
  outputPath: path.join(__dirname, 'profiling/profileEvents.json'),
});
```

In order to view the profile file:

1. Run webpack with `ProfilingPlugin`.
2. Go to Chrome, open DevTools, and go to the `Performance` tab (formerly `Timeline`).
3. Drag and drop generated file (`events.json` by default) into the profiler.

It will then display timeline stats and calls per plugin!
