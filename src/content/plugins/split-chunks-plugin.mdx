---

Originally, chunks (and modules imported inside them) were connected by a parent-child relationship in the internal webpack graph. The `CommonsChunkPlugin` was used to avoid duplicated dependencies across them, but further optimizations were not possible.

Since webpack v4, the `CommonsChunkPlugin` was removed in favor of `optimization.splitChunks`.

## Defaults

Out of the box `SplitChunksPlugin` should work well for most users.

By default it only affects on-demand chunks, because changing initial chunks would affect the script tags the HTML file should include to run the project.

webpack will automatically split chunks based on these conditions:

- New chunk can be shared OR modules are from the `node_modules` folder
- New chunk would be bigger than 20kb (before min+gz)
- Maximum number of parallel requests when loading chunks on demand would be lower or equal to 30
- Maximum number of parallel requests at initial page load would be lower or equal to 30

When trying to fulfill the last two conditions, bigger chunks are preferred.

## Configuration

webpack provides a set of options for developers that want more control over this functionality.

W> The default configuration was chosen to fit web performance best practices, but the optimal strategy for your project might differ. If you're changing the configuration, you should measure the impact of your changes to ensure there's a real benefit.

## `optimization.splitChunks`

This configuration object represents the default behavior of the `SplitChunksPlugin`.

**webpack.config.js**

```js
module.exports = {
  //...
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      chunks: 'async',
      minSize: 20000,
      minRemainingSize: 0,
      minChunks: 1,
      maxAsyncRequests: 30,
      maxInitialRequests: 30,
      enforceSizeThreshold: 50000,
      cacheGroups: {
        defaultVendors: {
          test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]/,
          priority: -10,
          reuseExistingChunk: true,
        },
        default: {
          minChunks: 2,
          priority: -20,
          reuseExistingChunk: true,
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

W> When files paths are processed by webpack, they always contain `/` on Unix systems and `\` on Windows. That's why using `[\\/]` in `{cacheGroup}.test` fields is necessary to represent a path separator. `/` or `\` in `{cacheGroup}.test` will cause issues when used cross-platform.

W> Since webpack 5, passing an entry name to `{cacheGroup}.test` and using a name of an existing chunk for `{cacheGroup}.name` is no longer allowed.

### `splitChunks.automaticNameDelimiter`

`string = '~'`

By default webpack will generate names using origin and name of the chunk (e.g. `vendors~main.js`). This option lets you specify the delimiter to use for the generated names.

### `splitChunks.chunks`

`string = 'async'` `function (chunk)`

This indicates which chunks will be selected for optimization. When a string is provided, valid values are `all`, `async`, and `initial`. Providing `all` can be particularly powerful, because it means that chunks can be shared even between async and non-async chunks.

**webpack.config.js**

```js
module.exports = {
  //...
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      // include all types of chunks
      chunks: 'all',
    },
  },
};
```

Alternatively, you may provide a function for more control. The return value will indicate whether to include each chunk.

```js
module.exports = {
  //...
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      chunks(chunk) {
        // exclude `my-excluded-chunk`
        return chunk.name !== 'my-excluded-chunk';
      },
    },
  },
};
```

T> You can combine this configuration with the [HtmlWebpackPlugin](/plugins/html-webpack-plugin/). It will inject all the generated vendor chunks for you.

### `splitChunks.maxAsyncRequests`

`number = 30`

Maximum number of parallel requests when on-demand loading.

### `splitChunks.maxInitialRequests`

`number = 30`

Maximum number of parallel requests at an entry point.

### `splitChunks.defaultSizeTypes`

`[string] = ['javascript', 'unknown']`

Sets the size types which are used when a number is used for sizes.

### `splitChunks.minChunks`

`number = 1`

The minimum times must a module be shared among chunks before splitting.

### `splitChunks.hidePathInfo`

`boolean`

Prevents exposing path info when creating names for parts splitted by maxSize.

### `splitChunks.minSize`

`number = 20000`

Minimum size, in bytes, for a chunk to be generated.

### `splitChunks.enforceSizeThreshold`

#### `splitChunks.cacheGroups.{cacheGroup}.enforceSizeThreshold`

`number = 50000`

Size threshold at which splitting is enforced and other restrictions (minRemainingSize, maxAsyncRequests, maxInitialRequests) are ignored.

### `splitChunks.minRemainingSize`

#### `splitChunks.cacheGroups.{cacheGroup}.minRemainingSize`

`number = 0`

`splitChunks.minRemainingSize` option was introduced in webpack 5 to avoid zero sized modules by ensuring that the minimum size of the chunk which remains after splitting is above a limit. Defaults to `0` in ['development' mode](/configuration/mode/#mode-development). For other cases `splitChunks.minRemainingSize` defaults to the value of `splitChunks.minSize` so it doesn't need to be specified manually except for the rare cases where deep control is required.

W> `splitChunks.minRemainingSize` only takes effect when a single chunk is remaining.

### `splitChunks.layer`

#### `splitChunks.cacheGroups.{cacheGroup}.layer`

`RegExp` `string` `function`

Assign modules to a cache group by module layer.

### `splitChunks.maxSize`

`number = 0`

Using `maxSize` (either globally `optimization.splitChunks.maxSize` per cache group `optimization.splitChunks.cacheGroups[x].maxSize` or for the fallback cache group `optimization.splitChunks.fallbackCacheGroup.maxSize`) tells webpack to try to split chunks bigger than `maxSize` bytes into smaller parts. Parts will be at least `minSize` (next to `maxSize`) in size.
The algorithm is deterministic and changes to the modules will only have local impact. So that it is usable when using long term caching and doesn't require records. `maxSize` is only a hint and could be violated when modules are bigger than `maxSize` or splitting would violate `minSize`.

When the chunk has a name already, each part will get a new name derived from that name. Depending on the value of `optimization.splitChunks.hidePathInfo` it will add a key derived from the first module name or a hash of it.

`maxSize` option is intended to be used with HTTP/2 and long term caching. It increases the request count for better caching. It could also be used to decrease the file size for faster rebuilding.

T> `maxSize` takes higher priority than `maxInitialRequest/maxAsyncRequests`. Actual priority is `maxInitialRequest/maxAsyncRequests < maxSize < minSize`.

T> Setting the value for `maxSize` sets the value for both `maxAsyncSize` and `maxInitialSize`.

### `splitChunks.maxAsyncSize`

`number`

Like `maxSize`, `maxAsyncSize` can be applied globally (`splitChunks.maxAsyncSize`), to cacheGroups (`splitChunks.cacheGroups.{cacheGroup}.maxAsyncSize`), or to the fallback cache group (`splitChunks.fallbackCacheGroup.maxAsyncSize`).

The difference between `maxAsyncSize` and `maxSize` is that `maxAsyncSize` will only affect on-demand loading chunks.

### `splitChunks.maxInitialSize`

`number`

Like `maxSize`, `maxInitialSize` can be applied globally (`splitChunks.maxInitialSize`), to cacheGroups (`splitChunks.cacheGroups.{cacheGroup}.maxInitialSize`), or to the fallback cache group (`splitChunks.fallbackCacheGroup.maxInitialSize`).

The difference between `maxInitialSize` and `maxSize` is that `maxInitialSize` will only affect initial load chunks.

### `splitChunks.name`

`boolean = false` `function (module, chunks, cacheGroupKey) => string` `string`

Also available for each cacheGroup: `splitChunks.cacheGroups.{cacheGroup}.name`.

The name of the split chunk. Providing `false` will keep the same name of the chunks so it doesn't change names unnecessarily. It is the recommended value for production builds.

Providing a string or a function allows you to use a custom name. Specifying either a string or a function that always returns the same string will merge all common modules and vendors into a single chunk. This might lead to bigger initial downloads and slow down page loads.

If you choose to specify a function, you may find the `chunk.name` and `chunk.hash` properties (where `chunk` is an element of the `chunks` array) particularly useful in choosing a name for your chunk.

If the `splitChunks.name` matches an [entry point](/configuration/entry-context/#entry) name, the entry point will be removed.

**main.js**

```js
import _ from 'lodash';

console.log(_.join(['Hello', 'webpack'], ' '));
```

**webpack.config.js**

```js
module.exports = {
  //...
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      cacheGroups: {
        commons: {
          test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]/,
          // cacheGroupKey here is `commons` as the key of the cacheGroup
          name(module, chunks, cacheGroupKey) {
            const moduleFileName = module
              .identifier()
              .split('/')
              .reduceRight((item) => item);
            const allChunksNames = chunks.map((item) => item.name).join('~');
            return `${cacheGroupKey}-${allChunksNames}-${moduleFileName}`;
          },
          chunks: 'all',
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

Running webpack with following `splitChunks` configuration would also output a chunk of the group common with next name: `commons-main-lodash.js.e7519d2bb8777058fa27.js` (hash given as an example of real world output).

W> When assigning equal names to different split chunks, all vendor modules are placed into a single shared chunk, though it's not recommend since it can result in more code downloaded.

### `splitChunks.usedExports`

#### `splitChunks.cacheGroups{cacheGroup}.usedExports`

`boolean = true`

Figure out which exports are used by modules to mangle export names, omit unused exports and generate more efficient code.
When it is `true`: analyse used exports for each runtime, when it is `"global"`: analyse exports globally for all runtimes combined).

### `splitChunks.cacheGroups`

Cache groups can inherit and/or override any options from `splitChunks.*`; but `test`, `priority` and `reuseExistingChunk` can only be configured on cache group level. To disable any of the default cache groups, set them to `false`.

**webpack.config.js**

```js
module.exports = {
  //...
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      cacheGroups: {
        default: false,
      },
    },
  },
};
```

#### `splitChunks.cacheGroups.{cacheGroup}.priority`

`number = -20`

A module can belong to multiple cache groups. The optimization will prefer the cache group with a higher `priority`. The default groups have a negative priority to allow custom groups to take higher priority (default value is `0` for custom groups).

#### `splitChunks.cacheGroups.{cacheGroup}.reuseExistingChunk`

`boolean = true`

If the current chunk contains modules already split out from the main bundle, it will be reused instead of a new one being generated. This can impact the resulting file name of the chunk.

**webpack.config.js**

```js
module.exports = {
  //...
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      cacheGroups: {
        defaultVendors: {
          reuseExistingChunk: true,
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

#### `splitChunks.cacheGroups.{cacheGroup}.type`

`function` `RegExp` `string`

Allows to assign modules to a cache group by module type.

**webpack.config.js**

```js
module.exports = {
  //...
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      cacheGroups: {
        json: {
          type: 'json',
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

#### `splitChunks.cacheGroups.test`

#### `splitChunks.cacheGroups.{cacheGroup}.test`

`function (module, { chunkGraph, moduleGraph }) => boolean` `RegExp` `string`

Controls which modules are selected by this cache group. Omitting it selects all modules. It can match the absolute module resource path or chunk names. When a chunk name is matched, all modules in the chunk are selected.

Providing a function to`{cacheGroup}.test`:

**webpack.config.js**

```js
module.exports = {
  //...
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      cacheGroups: {
        svgGroup: {
          test(module) {
            // `module.resource` contains the absolute path of the file on disk.
            // Note the usage of `path.sep` instead of / or \, for cross-platform compatibility.
            const path = require('path');
            return (
              module.resource &&
              module.resource.endsWith('.svg') &&
              module.resource.includes(`${path.sep}cacheable_svgs${path.sep}`)
            );
          },
        },
        byModuleTypeGroup: {
          test(module) {
            return module.type === 'javascript/auto';
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

In order to see what information is available in `module` and `chunks` objects, you can put `debugger;` statement in the callback. Then [run your webpack build in debug mode](/contribute/debugging/#devtools) to inspect the parameters in Chromium DevTools.

Providing a `RegExp` to `{cacheGroup}.test`:

**webpack.config.js**

```js
module.exports = {
  //...
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      cacheGroups: {
        defaultVendors: {
          // Note the usage of `[\\/]` as a path separator for cross-platform compatibility.
          test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]|vendor[\\/]analytics_provider|vendor[\\/]other_lib/,
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

#### `splitChunks.cacheGroups.{cacheGroup}.filename`

`string` `function (pathData, assetInfo) => string`

Allows to override the filename when and only when it's an initial chunk.
All placeholders available in [`output.filename`](/configuration/output/#outputfilename) are also available here.

W> This option can also be set globally in `splitChunks.filename`, but this isn't recommended and will likely lead to an error if [`splitChunks.chunks`](#splitchunkschunks) is not set to `'initial'`. Avoid setting it globally.

**webpack.config.js**

```js
module.exports = {
  //...
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      cacheGroups: {
        defaultVendors: {
          filename: '[name].bundle.js',
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

And as a function:

**webpack.config.js**

```js
module.exports = {
  //...
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      cacheGroups: {
        defaultVendors: {
          filename: (pathData) => {
            // Use pathData object for generating filename string based on your requirements
            return `${pathData.chunk.name}-bundle.js`;
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

It is possible to create a folder structure by providing path prefixing the filename: `'js/vendor/bundle.js'`.

**webpack.config.js**

```js
module.exports = {
  //...
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      cacheGroups: {
        defaultVendors: {
          filename: 'js/[name]/bundle.js',
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

#### `splitChunks.cacheGroups.{cacheGroup}.enforce`

`boolean = false`

Tells webpack to ignore [`splitChunks.minSize`](#splitchunksminsize), [`splitChunks.minChunks`](#splitchunksminchunks), [`splitChunks.maxAsyncRequests`](#splitchunksmaxasyncrequests) and [`splitChunks.maxInitialRequests`](#splitchunksmaxinitialrequests) options and always create chunks for this cache group.

**webpack.config.js**

```js
module.exports = {
  //...
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      cacheGroups: {
        defaultVendors: {
          enforce: true,
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

#### `splitChunks.cacheGroups.{cacheGroup}.idHint`

`string`

Sets the hint for chunk id. It will be added to chunk's filename.

**webpack.config.js**

```js
module.exports = {
  //...
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      cacheGroups: {
        defaultVendors: {
          idHint: 'vendors',
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

## Examples

### Defaults: Example 1

```js
// index.js

import('./a'); // dynamic import
```

```js
// a.js
import 'react';

//...
```

**Result:** A separate chunk would be created containing `react`. At the import call this chunk is loaded in parallel to the original chunk containing `./a`.

Why:

- Condition 1: The chunk contains modules from `node_modules`
- Condition 2: `react` is bigger than 30kb
- Condition 3: Number of parallel requests at the import call is 2
- Condition 4: Doesn't affect request at initial page load

What's the reasoning behind this? `react` probably won't change as often as your application code. By moving it into a separate chunk this chunk can be cached separately from your app code (assuming you are using chunkhash, records, Cache-Control or other long term cache approach).

### Defaults: Example 2

```js
// entry.js

// dynamic imports
import('./a');
import('./b');
```

```js
// a.js
import './helpers'; // helpers is 40kb in size

//...
```

```js
// b.js
import './helpers';
import './more-helpers'; // more-helpers is also 40kb in size

//...
```

**Result:** A separate chunk would be created containing `./helpers` and all dependencies of it. At the import calls this chunk is loaded in parallel to the original chunks.

Why:

- Condition 1: The chunk is shared between both import calls
- Condition 2: `helpers` is bigger than 30kb
- Condition 3: Number of parallel requests at the import calls is 2
- Condition 4: Doesn't affect request at initial page load

Putting the content of `helpers` into each chunk will result into its code being downloaded twice. By using a separate chunk this will only happen once. We pay the cost of an additional request, which could be considered a tradeoff. That's why there is a minimum size of 30kb.

### Split Chunks: Example 1

Create a `commons` chunk, which includes all code shared between entry points.

**webpack.config.js**

```js
module.exports = {
  //...
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      cacheGroups: {
        commons: {
          name: 'commons',
          chunks: 'initial',
          minChunks: 2,
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

W> This configuration can enlarge your initial bundles, it is recommended to use dynamic imports when a module is not immediately needed.

### Split Chunks: Example 2

Create a `vendors` chunk, which includes all code from `node_modules` in the whole application.

**webpack.config.js**

```js
module.exports = {
  //...
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      cacheGroups: {
        commons: {
          test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]/,
          name: 'vendors',
          chunks: 'all',
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

W> This might result in a large chunk containing all external packages. It is recommended to only include your core frameworks and utilities and dynamically load the rest of the dependencies.

### Split Chunks: Example 3

Create a `custom vendor` chunk, which contains certain `node_modules` packages matched by `RegExp`.

**webpack.config.js**

```js
module.exports = {
  //...
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      cacheGroups: {
        vendor: {
          test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/](react|react-dom)[\\/]/,
          name: 'vendor',
          chunks: 'all',
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

T> This will result in splitting `react` and `react-dom` into a separate chunk. If you're not sure what packages have been included in a chunk you may refer to [Bundle Analysis](/guides/code-splitting/#bundle-analysis) section for details.
